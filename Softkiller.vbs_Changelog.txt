v1.0 - Initial commit. Add application.

-v1.0. 
-Tried this app with a variety of user accounts. Admin doesn't work. Must run as the invoked user. Must invoke the user who has applications open. 
-Schedule with Task Scheduler using a GPO under "User Configuration" in order to make the task run as the current user.
-This script is for killing tasks (especially Office tasks) for the purpose of unlocking in-use files for backups.
-If a backup operation failes this can be run against the running application to try and gently kill it.
-For example, use this with a scheduled task at night to kill Outlook.exe so that Windows Backup can get access to Outlook.pst files.
